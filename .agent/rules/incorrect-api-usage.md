When you run code and receive an error about API Signatures, please search up the documentation for that specific code and look at source code. Then reason how you're code differs and if you may have made any incorrect steps prior. After all that, Proceed to reasoning and implementing the fix. Tool usage is better than reasoning for library based issues.
